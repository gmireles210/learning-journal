# Computer Architecture and Logic

## How do Computers Really Work?

What makes a computer work?

  - Takes input
    - Keyboard, mouse, microphone, sensors, touchscreens, etc.
  
  - Stores info
    - Memory via processor
  
  - Process
    - Algorithms
    
  - Output results
    - Games, singals to control robots
    
Early computers were made out of wood and gears, later were the size of rooms

## Binary and Data

- Ones and zeros (1/0)
- Wires and circuits
-	How do you store data from electricity? 
-	On/off, 1/0, yes, no, true, false
-	Binary number system
  o	Decimal # system (0-9)
  o	Binary (0-1)
  o	Binary system
  o	Numbered system similar to decimal
  o	Images, text, and sound can be represented by binary
  o	Pixels (colors) RGB
  o	Sound in binary
    	Series of vibrations
    	Waveforms
      •	Series of numbers
      
## Circuits and Logic

- Circuits
  o	Modify inputs
    -	A simple circuit takes input and flips it
    -	Complicated ones take multiple signals and combine them
    -	Logic gates
    -	Nand, and, etc
    -	Adders (type of circuit)
    -	Old circuits were the size of coffee tables
    -	Today they are microscopic
    
## CPU, Memory, Input and Output

  - Central Processing Unit (CPU)
  - Requests info from memory
  - Sent to output (screen)
  - 3D printers
  
## Hardware and Software

  - Circuits, chips, speakers, plugs, etc
    -	Software (apps, code, etc)
    -	CPU is the master chip that controls everything else
    -	Real magic is how the CPU knows which circuit to use
    -	Software tells the CPU what to do
    -	Operating system (OS)
      o	Master program
