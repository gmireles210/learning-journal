# What is CSS and How Does it Work?

> CSS associates style rules with HTML elements

> CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements
  should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: *a selector* and a *declaration*
  
- CSS properties affect how elements are displayed

- CSS can be used externally

- CSS can also be used internally

- CSS can be set-up as external style sheets that can be called upon inside the HTML

## Summary of CSS

  - CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look
  
  - Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rules apply to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like)
  
  - Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements
  
  - Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties
  
  - CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page
