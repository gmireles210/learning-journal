# What is a Script?

- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal 
  You could compare scripts to any of the following:
    - Recipes
    - Handbooks
    - Manuals
    
- To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it

- Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps 

  1. Define the goal
  2. Design the script
  3. Code each step
  
- Sketch out the script by tasks in a flowchart

## Summary

  - A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal
  
  - Each the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions
  
  - Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically
  
  - To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task
  
# Expressions

- An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of experessions
  - Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
  - Expressions that use two or more values to returen a single value
  
# Operators

- Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
  - Examples of operators:
    - Assignment Operators
    - Arithmetic Operators
    - String Operators
    - Comparison Operators
    - Logical Operators
    
- Arithmetic Operators
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Division
  - Multiplication
  - Increment
  - Decrement
  - Modulus
  
  - Order of execution:
    - Multiplication and division are preformed **BEFORE** addition or subtraction
  
- String Operators
  - There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it
  
  - Can use concatenation
  
  - Mix number and strings together
  
## Summary

  - A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe
  
  - Scripts conatin very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value
  
  - Vairable are used to temporarily store pieces of info. used in the script
  
  - Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piefce of related info
  
  - JS distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false)
  
  - Expressions evaluate into single value
  
  - Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value
  
# What is a Function?

  - Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)
  
  - Grouping together the statements that are required to answer a question or perform a task helps organize your code
  
  - Basic Functions
  
  - Declaring a function
  
  - Calling a function
  
  - Declaring functions that need info
  
  - Calling functions that need info
  
  - Getting a single value out of a function
  
  - Getting multiple values out of a function
