# Growth Mindset

*Growth Mindset* to me is being able to recognize when you are faced with a "fork" in your thought or decision process. For instance, in the morning you can decide whether to show up to work either a little early for tackle a task at work or show up on time and work through that specific task first thing while attempting to get other work done.

Growth Mindset to me could also be phrased as:

> Choose the hard right over the easy wrong.

By choosing to implement the Growth Mindset you essentially decide to push yourself to accomplish whatever task might be at hand such as deciding to workout or not, stay late or come in early to finish an important piece of code for work, etc. There are many examples of the *Growth Mindset* but the above description is what it means to me in a quick summary.

## List of 3 Reminders to Myself of How to Stay in a Growth Mindset:

- Actively put forth the effort to push yourself

- Use the success of others as motivation to continually push yourself

- Take criticism as a positive, as doing so will help you grow and maintain the "Growth Mindset!"
