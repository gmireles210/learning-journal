# What is Markdown and how it is associated with GitHub?

GitHub is an open-source resource that many (if not all developers) use or have used at some point in time. It allows the user to create a repository that essentially stores all the code and associated data for a variety of web development needs such as *HTML, JS, CSS, Python, etc.*

When you first create a GitHub repo, you are prompted to create a readme.md file which acts as an informational page that lets a user of your page know what they are looking at. The readme.md file is created by using a language called "MarkedDown" which is where the .md comes from at the end of the readme file.
In order to properly learn markdown, GitHub has published a few pages that goes over how to create a readme.md file using markdown by adding heading, sub-headings, quotes, indents, pictures, theme's, etc.

If you wanted to learn more about this, I would suggest checking out some of the resources such as:

[Basics of Markdown](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#referencing-external-resources).

[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

There are many more resources out there if you wanted to search further and "Dive Deep" into Markdown but for now, the above links should be more than sufficient to get someone started.
