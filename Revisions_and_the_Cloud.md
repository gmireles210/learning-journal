## A Quick Guide to Version Control with Git

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that allows a user to revisit varying versions of a file or set of files by recording changes
By utilizing a VCS, you can revert back to older files if mistakes are made or to simply compare files

There are 3 different types of Version Control:

- Local Version Control

- Centralized Version Control

- Distributed Version Control

## What is Git?

Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) that consists of the following elements:

- Snapshots

-Local Operations

- Tracking Changes

- Loss of Data

- States

  - Committed
  - Modified
  - Staged

Git can be downloaded for Linux, Windows, and Mac

  - Once downloaded, there are a few minor but very important tasks to do to ensure proper set-up

Git needs a Repository (Repo) where you store your projects files and from there, you can clone, commit a file, commit changes, push changes, and stash changes.
