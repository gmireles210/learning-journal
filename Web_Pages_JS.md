# Basics of JavaScript (JS)

  - Statements (What are they?)
    - A script is a series of instructions that a computer follows one-by-one.
      Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement 
      Statements should end with a semicolon (;)
    - They can be organized into code blocks
      
  - JS is **CASE SENSITIVE**
  
# Comments

  - Help explain what your code is/does
  - /* some text */ (multi-line comments)
  - // (single line comments)
  
# Variables

  - Data stored that contains bits of info a script needs to do its job
  
  - Can create shorthand for variables
  
  - How to declare a var (variable)
    - var quantity;
      - var = variable keyword
      - quantity = variable name
      
  - Assign a value to them
    - quantity = 3;
      - quantity = var name
      - 3 = var value
      
  - Data types
    - Numeric
    - String
    - Boolean (true or false)
   
# RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES

  1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
  
  2. The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name. 
  
  3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript.
  
  4. All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases. 
  
  5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, fi rstName might be used to store a person's first name, l astNarne for their last name, and age for their age.
  
  6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. For example, f i rstName rather than fi rstnarne (this is referred to as camel case). You can also use an underscore between each word (you cannot use a dash).
